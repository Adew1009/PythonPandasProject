# PythonPandasProject

This is a Jupyter Notebook to explore pandas and seaborn.

I used a CSV file of Ultra Marathons and then used pandas to alter the DataFrame and seaborn to display data.

To Get Started the same way I did you will need to have VS Code with the Python and Jupyter extensions installed. 

-Create Virtual Enviroment
#python -m venv ./venv
-Launch Virtual Enviroment
#source ./venv/bin/activate
-Install pandas and seaborn dependancies for the virtual enviroment
#pip install pandas seaborn
-Create a .gitignore in your project folder and add csv, venv, and python cache 
    * I added my CSV file to the gitignore due to its size. If you use a smaller CSV file, you wouldnt need to include it.
